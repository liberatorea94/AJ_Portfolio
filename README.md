# Project 1: PCA Dimensionality Reduction Effects on Training Handwritten Digit Classifier
Created by Sunny Lee (lees19@wit.edu) and AJ Liberatore (liberatorea@wit.edu)

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to see the effects of dimensionality reduction on training neural networks, specifically to see the effects of dimensionality reduction on a MLPClassifier for recognizing handwritten digits and how dimensionality reduction can help with saving both space and time.
