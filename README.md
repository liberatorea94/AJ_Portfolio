# Project 1: US Senate Committees Tableau Story
Created by AJ Liberatore (liberatorea@wit.edu) and Jayden Butts (buttsj@wit.edu)

## Introduction
Created a Tableua story to illustrate the interconnectedness of the US Senate, as well as to illustrate issues with diversity.

# [Project 2: PCA Dimensionality Reduction Effects on Training Handwritten Digit Classifier](https://github.com/lees19atwit/DS-Final)
Created by Sunny Lee (lees19@wit.edu) and AJ Liberatore (liberatorea@wit.edu)

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to see the effects of dimensionality reduction on training neural networks, specifically to see the effects of dimensionality reduction on a MLPClassifier for recognizing handwritten digits and how dimensionality reduction can help with saving both space and time. 

## Data
We used the MNIST Handwritten data set. MNIST comes with 60,000 samples of 28x28 handwritten digits and an additional 10,000 samples as training data. Here are 100 samples of the training data set:
